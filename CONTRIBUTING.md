## Guidelines

We will review and help with all reasonable pull requests as long as the guidlines below are met.

### Code:
- Spaces and line breaks should be used to break up code and make it readable, we prefer readability over compactness.
- `if` statements should be wrapped in curly backets if they are any longer than a few words, *not* formatted with only a newline.
- In general, check existing code to make sure your code matches relatively close to the code already in the project.

### Other:
- The license header must be applied to all java source code files.
- IDE or system related files should be added to the `.gitignore`, never committed in pull requests.
